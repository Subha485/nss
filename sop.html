<h1 style="font-family: 'Tourney', cursive;">SOP For NSS Web Team</h1><br>
<img src="./assets/SOP.jpeg"/>
<p style="font-family: 'Kalam', cursive;">My main motive to become the convener of NSS Web team is to work with the team in developing 
   flawless website that showcases the initiatives of NSS so that their initiatives get the right
   recognition. My passion for coding started with cs101 in first semester and since then I'm very 
   passionate about web development and coding.I have learnt python,SQL in high school, c++ in 
   first semester and with the knowledge of html,css,bootstrap,javascript from online courses I'm 
   sure I can contribute well to the web team in developing websites.Though I'm not an expert in this 
   field,I'm a quick learner who is always eager to learn new languages and skills.Therefore I'm looking 
   forward to sharpen my web development skills as well as other soft skills by working with the team.</p>
